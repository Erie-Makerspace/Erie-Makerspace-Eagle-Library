Erie-Makerspace-Eagle-Library
=============================

A custom Eagle library tailored to the needs of Erie Makerspace classes &amp; activities.


There are two ways to install this library:

Option 1) "Static" version: use this option if you just want to download the library once and don't plan to update it often or at all.
Click the "Download ZIP" button on github and unzip the downloaded file into the lbr/ directory in your Eagle installation.

Option 2) "Live" version: use this option if you plan to update regularly or want to be sure you always have the most recent version.
Click the "Clone in Desktop" button on github and select the lbr/ directory in your Eagle installation. You can run `git pull` as needed to grab future updates.


Additionally, there are two ways to use this library once installed:

Option 1) General use: once you have installed the library, run Eagle. In the control panel, expand "Libraries," find "Erie-Makerspace-Eagle-Library," then right-click on it and select "Use all." This will make parts from the library available along side all the normally available parts.

Option 2) Class use: once you have installed the library, run Eagle. In the control panel, right-click on "Libraries" and select "Use none." Then, expand "Libraries," find "Erie-Makerspace-Eagle-Library," then right-click on it and select "Use all." This will hide all the normally-available parts and make only parts from the custom library available for easier searching & selecting.
